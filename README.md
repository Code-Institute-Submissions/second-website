## Features
* Responsive on mobile and tablet as well as desktop sizes.
* The photography page has an intentional side scroll on desktop size. On mobile device sizes the pictures are displayed vertically stacked.
* The positioning of the wiggling contact buttons in desktop mode is intentional. The bottom border over the header line was a style choice. 
* Navigation menu is intentionally at the bottom of the page, taking into consideration that the majority of users is expected to be using a mobile device. This provides easy access. The navigation bar is designed to be minimal and non-intrusive. On the photography page it allows the images to be displayed as big as possible while being non-intrusive and blending in.
