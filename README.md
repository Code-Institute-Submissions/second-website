# Personal Website for photography and front end

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`


## UX
This website aims to give potential clients an impression of my capacities as both a programmer and a photographer.

As someone in need of an event photographer, I want to see sharp picture without too many distractions. Pictures should speak for themselves.
As a product manager I want to see an attractive portfolio of webpages featuring great product photography and flashy animations to draw attention to the product.
As a hiring manager for full stack developer positions I want to see a well argued portfolio.
